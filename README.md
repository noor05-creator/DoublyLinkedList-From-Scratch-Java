# Doubly Linked List From Scratch in Java

This repository contains a complete implementation of a **Doubly Linked List** in Java using both `head` and `tail` pointers. All major operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching are implemented from scratch — without using any Java library collections.

## 🚀 Features

- `pushFront(int data)` – Insert at the beginning
- `pushBack(int data)` – Insert at the end
- `insertAtIndex(int data, int position)` – Insert at a specific index
- `popFront()` – Remove element from the front
- `popBack()` – Remove element from the end
- `deleteAtIndex(int index)` – Delete node at a specific index
- `deleteThroughdata(int data)` – Delete first node with a specific value
- `isEmpty()` – Check if the list is empty
- `print()` – Print the list from head to tail

## 💡 Learning Focus

This project is part of my **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** practice to master:

- Bidirectional node linking
- Pointer manipulation (next & prev)
- Special case handling (insertion/deletion at head, tail, or only node)
- Dynamic memory and structure control

## 📂 File Structure

- `Node` – Doubly linked node with `data`, `prev`, and `next`
- `doublyLL` – Class implementing the doubly linked list logic
- `Main` – Sample test cases and operations

## 🛠️ Built With

- Java
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA
